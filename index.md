These are the web-based [*rauemi*](https://maoridictionary.co.nz/search?idiom=&phrase=&proverb=&loan=&histLoanWords=&keywords=rauemi) (resources) for [Ruatau: connecting Māori genomic scientists and communities](https://www.genomics-aotearoa.org.nz/projects/ruatau)

### What is Ruatau?  
Ruatau is a [Genomics Aotearoa project](https://www.genomics-aotearoa.org.nz/projects/ruatau) that aims to support kaipūtaiao Māori who grew up Te Ao Pākehā — through cultural upskilling, to hold genomics wānanga (workshops) in a collaborative manner with Māori communities. Our aim is to use the opportunity for both parties to learn (i.e. a tuakana-teina relationship) to increase understanding of genomics and associated risks and benefits in Māori communities, and to enable kaipūtaiao Māori who grew up Te Ao Pākehā to increase their understanding of mātauranga Māori/tikanga through working with these communities, hopefully leading to reconnection with their own whānau/hapū!  

### Ko wai mātou? Who are we?
This project is being led by Alana Alexander (Ngāpuhi: Te Hikutu, Pākehā), Catherine Collins (Kāi Tahu, Pākehā), both at the University of Otago, and Simon Hills (Ngāti Porou, Pākehā), based at Massey University. We also have a wonderful [*rōpū tautoko*](https://translate.google.com/?hl=mi&sl=mi&tl=en&text=r%C5%8Dp%C5%AB%20tautoko&op=translate) (advisory group), who will be keeping an eye on us!

### Formatting
[*Kupu*](https://maoridictionary.co.nz/search?idiom=&phrase=&proverb=&loan=&histLoanWords=&keywords=kupu) (words) in [*te reo*](https://translate.google.com/?hl=mi&sl=mi&tl=en&text=te%20reo&op=translate) Māori (the Māori languaged) are rendered in italics, with links that will take you to the [*tikanga*](https://maoridictionary.co.nz/search?idiom=&phrase=&proverb=&loan=&histLoanWords=&keywords=tikanga) (meanings) of the words. In most cases, a translation will also be provided at least the first time a kupu is used on a page. Remember kupu can have multiple meanings!  

### Rauemi linked to from here
[*Ako_ano*](ako_ano/index.md) (more learning): this is a collection of additional info for some of the concepts that might have come up in our [*wānanga*](https://maoridictionary.co.nz/search?idiom=&phrase=&proverb=&loan=&histLoanWords=&keywords=w%C4%81nanga) (hui for learning together).

### Current version
These resources are yet to go through our [*rōpū tautoko*](https://translate.google.com/?hl=mi&sl=mi&tl=en&text=r%C5%8Dp%C5%AB%20tautoko&op=translate) and [*hapori Māori*](https://translate.google.com/?hl=mi&sl=mi&tl=en&text=hapori%20M%C4%81ori%0A&op=translate) (Māori communities), who help to ensure all [*rauemi*](https://maoridictionary.co.nz/search?idiom=&phrase=&proverb=&loan=&histLoanWords=&keywords=rauemi) created are [*tika*](https://maoridictionary.co.nz/search?idiom=&phrase=&proverb=&loan=&histLoanWords=&keywords=tika) (correct). Therefore, please [*kia tūpato*](https://translate.google.com/?hl=mi&sl=mi&tl=en&text=kia%20t%C5%ABpato%0A&op=translate) (be careful) if you are utilising them.
