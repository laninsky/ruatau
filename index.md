These are the web-based [*rauemi*](https://maoridictionary.co.nz/search?idiom=&phrase=&proverb=&loan=&histLoanWords=&keywords=rauemi) (resources) for [Ruatau: connecting Māori genomic scientists and communities](https://www.genomics-aotearoa.org.nz/projects/ruatau).

### What is Ruatau?  
Ruatau is a [Genomics Aotearoa project](https://www.genomics-aotearoa.org.nz/projects/ruatau) that aims to support [*kaipūtaiao Māori*](https://translate.google.com/?hl=mi&sl=mi&tl=en&text=kaip%C5%ABtaiao%20M%C4%81ori&op=translate) (Māori scientists) who grew up [*Te Ao Pākehā*](https://translate.google.com/?hl=mi&sl=mi&tl=en&text=te%20ao%20P%C4%81keh%C4%81&op=translate) (in the Pākehā world) — through cultural upskilling, to hold genomics [*wānanga*](https://maoridictionary.co.nz/search?idiom=&phrase=&proverb=&loan=&histLoanWords=&keywords=w%C4%81nanga) in a collaborative manner with Māori communities. Our aim is to use the opportunity for both parties to learn (i.e. a [*tuakana*](https://maoridictionary.co.nz/search?idiom=&phrase=&proverb=&loan=&histLoanWords=&keywords=tuakana)-[*teina*](https://maoridictionary.co.nz/search?idiom=&phrase=&proverb=&loan=&histLoanWords=&keywords=teina) relationship) to increase understanding of genomics and associated risks and benefits in Māori communities, and to enable [*kaipūtaiao Māori*](https://translate.google.com/?hl=mi&sl=mi&tl=en&text=kaip%C5%ABtaiao%20M%C4%81ori&op=translate) who grew up [*Te Ao Pākehā*](https://translate.google.com/?hl=mi&sl=mi&tl=en&text=te%20ao%20P%C4%81keh%C4%81&op=translate) to increase their understanding of [*mātauranga*](https://maoridictionary.co.nz/search?idiom=&phrase=&proverb=&loan=&histLoanWords=&keywords=m%C4%81tauranga)/[*tikanga*](https://maoridictionary.co.nz/search?idiom=&phrase=&proverb=&loan=&histLoanWords=&keywords=tikanga) *Māori* (Māori knowledge and protocols) through working with these communities, hopefully leading to reconnection with their own [*whānau*](https://maoridictionary.co.nz/search?idiom=&phrase=&proverb=&loan=&histLoanWords=&keywords=wh%C4%81nau)/[*hapū*](https://maoridictionary.co.nz/search?idiom=&phrase=&proverb=&loan=&histLoanWords=&keywords=hap%C5%AB)!  

### Ko wai mātou? Who are we?
This project is being led by Alana Alexander (Ngāpuhi: Te Hikutu, Pākehā), Catherine Collins (Kāi Tahu, Pākehā), both at the University of Otago, and Simon Hills (Ngāti Porou, Pākehā), based at Massey University. We also have a wonderful rōpū tautoko ([advisory group](kaimahi/index.md)), who will be keeping an eye on us, as we fall into the category of [*kaipūtaiao Māori*](https://translate.google.com/?hl=mi&sl=mi&tl=en&text=kaip%C5%ABtaiao%20M%C4%81ori&op=translate) who grew up [*Te Ao Pākehā*](https://translate.google.com/?hl=mi&sl=mi&tl=en&text=te%20ao%20P%C4%81keh%C4%81&op=translate).

### How did this project come about?
Catherine and Alana attended the [SING Indigenous Genomics Conference](https://www.singaotearoa.nz/singconference-2020) back in 2020. Although super inspiring to hear all the [*kairangahau Māori*](https://translate.google.com/?hl=mi&sl=mi&tl=en&text=kairangahau%20M%C4%81ori&op=translate) standing strong in their [*Māoritanga*](https://maoridictionary.co.nz/search?idiom=&phrase=&proverb=&loan=&histLoanWords=&keywords=maoritanga) (Māoriness), it also made both of them feel a bit [*whakamā*](https://maoridictionary.co.nz/search?idiom=&phrase=&proverb=&loan=&histLoanWords=&keywords=whakam%C4%81) (embarrassed) about their own cultural connections. They started brain-storming about what they could do to be of service to [*hapori Māori*](https://translate.google.com/?hl=mi&sl=mi&tl=en&text=hapori%20M%C4%81ori&op=translate) (Māori communities), and from these initial [*kōrero*](https://maoridictionary.co.nz/search?idiom=&phrase=&proverb=&loan=&histLoanWords=&keywords=k%C5%8Drero) (discussions), Ruatau was born.

### He aha te tikanga o te ingoa? What is the meaning of the name?
We were lucky enough to lean on the mātauranga of [Dr. Karaitiana Taiuru](https://www.taiuru.maori.nz/) for this. Traditional Māori weavers have a helix shape in weaving and [*kōwhaiwhai*](https://maoridictionary.co.nz/search?idiom=&phrase=&proverb=&loan=&histLoanWords=&keywords=k%C5%8Dwhaiwhai) that has [*whakapapa*](https://maoridictionary.co.nz/search?idiom=&phrase=&proverb=&loan=&histLoanWords=&keywords=whakapapa) about representing the interwoven nature of different forms of knowledge.

### Formatting
[*Kupu*](https://maoridictionary.co.nz/search?idiom=&phrase=&proverb=&loan=&histLoanWords=&keywords=kupu) (words) in [*te reo*](https://translate.google.com/?hl=mi&sl=mi&tl=en&text=te%20reo&op=translate) Māori (the Māori languaged) are rendered in italics, with links that will take you to the [*tikanga*](https://maoridictionary.co.nz/search?idiom=&phrase=&proverb=&loan=&histLoanWords=&keywords=tikanga) (meanings) of the words. In most cases, a translation will also be provided at least the first time a kupu is used on a page. Remember kupu can have multiple meanings! Links in 'normal formatting' will take you to additional information (some pages will be external to Ruatau).

### Rauemi linked to from here
[*Ako_ano*](ako_ano/index.md) (more learning): this is a collection of additional info for some of the concepts that might have come up in our [*wānanga*](https://maoridictionary.co.nz/search?idiom=&phrase=&proverb=&loan=&histLoanWords=&keywords=w%C4%81nanga).

These resources are yet to go through our [*rōpū tautoko*](https://translate.google.com/?hl=mi&sl=mi&tl=en&text=r%C5%8Dp%C5%AB%20tautoko&op=translate) and [*hapori Māori*](https://translate.google.com/?hl=mi&sl=mi&tl=en&text=hapori%20M%C4%81ori%0A&op=translate) (Māori communities), who help to ensure all [*rauemi*](https://maoridictionary.co.nz/search?idiom=&phrase=&proverb=&loan=&histLoanWords=&keywords=rauemi) created are [*tika*](https://maoridictionary.co.nz/search?idiom=&phrase=&proverb=&loan=&histLoanWords=&keywords=tika) (correct). Therefore, please [*kia tūpato*](https://translate.google.com/?hl=mi&sl=mi&tl=en&text=kia%20t%C5%ABpato%0A&op=translate) (be careful) if you are utilising them.
