### Whakataukī
A [*whakataukī*](https://maoridictionary.co.nz/word/9903) can be thought of as a proverb. Often these are quite beautiful - or witty - turns of phrase that can be used to describe a situation, or a person. There are many [*rauemi*](https://maoridictionary.co.nz/word/6599) online about [*whakataukī*](https://maoridictionary.co.nz/word/9903) and their importance to [*Te Ao Māori*](https://translate.google.com/?hl=mi&sl=mi&tl=en&text=te%20ao%20M%C4%81ori%0A&op=translate), so have a [*kūkura*](https://maoridictionary.co.nz/word/43980) (google!).  

A few [*whakataukī*](https://maoridictionary.co.nz/word/9903) you might have come across in Ruatau include:  
*Tūwhitia te hopo, mairangatia te angitū*: feel the fear and do it anyway!  

*Ko te manu e kai ana i te miro, nōna te ngahere; ko te manu e kai ana i te mātauranga, nōna te ao*: the bird that partakes of the miro berry has reign of the forest; the bird that partakes of knowledge has reign of the world.  

Some distinguish [*whakataukī*](https://maoridictionary.co.nz/word/9903) where the ultimate author is unknown from [*whakatauakī*](https://maoridictionary.co.nz/word/9899), where the author is known. One well-known [*whakatauakī*](https://maoridictionary.co.nz/word/9899) is from [Tā Apirana Ngata](https://teara.govt.nz/en/biographies/3n5/ngata-apirana-turupa):  
*E tipu e rea mo ngā rā o tō ao  
Ko tō ringa ki ngā rākau ā te Pakeha Hei ara mō tō tinana  
Ko tō ngākau ki ngā tāonga a ō tīpuna Māori  
Hei tikitiki mō tō māhuna  
Ko tō wairua ki tō Atua, nānā nei ngā mea katoa*  

Grow up and thrive for the days destined to you.  
Your hands to the tools of the Pākehā to provide physical sustenance,  
Your heart to the treasures of your Māori ancestors as a diadem for your brow,  
Your soul to your God, to whom all things belong.  

### Karakia
A [*karakia*](https://maoridictionary.co.nz/word/2275) is an invocation/ incantation/request, often to the [*atua*](https://maoridictionary.co.nz/word/494), to:
* safely transverse beginnings and ends (e.g. of [*hui*](https://maoridictionary.co.nz/word/1528))
* to empower objects, people, and common purposes
* to remove [*tapu*](https://maoridictionary.co.nz/word/7504)
* to acknowledge the atua

There are some 'unspoken' rules to karakia, and one of these is audience particpation! The following are common endings to karakia, with the bits spoken by all highlighted in bold:
* Tūturu ka whakamaua kia tina, **tina**, haumi e, hui e, **tāiki e**!
* Whano, whano, hara mai te toki, haumi e, hui e, **tāiki e**!
* Tihei **mauri ora**!
* **Āmine**
The 'tāike e' ending denotes [coming together for a sense of shared purpose](https://tearawhiti.wordpress.com/tag/beginners/), 'Tihei mauri ora' traces back to the creation of Hineahuone by Tāne (the (['sneeze of life'](https://teara.govt.nz/en/artwork/5173/tane-breathes-life-into-hineahuone)), and Āmine is often used with Christian karakia.

There are many online resources for learning more about karakia, including [Te Ara](https://teara.govt.nz/en/traditional-maori-religion-nga-karakia-a-te-maori/page-4), Dr. Karaitiana Taiuru's [website](https://taiuru.co.nz/karakia-or-cultural-appropriation/), and Ōtākou Whakaihu Waka's [karakia page](https://www.otago.ac.nz/maori/world/te-reo-maori/karakia-prayers).
